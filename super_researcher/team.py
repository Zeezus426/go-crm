# Alright we have a few agents here we have a deep researcher, and 2 general researchers, and a orchestrator.
# Both of them feed the neo4j vector hourly with new data from the web and other sources. 
# Then everyday we have the orchestrator agent summarize the findings of the researchers then give a list of possible clients interested in gosupplys services.
